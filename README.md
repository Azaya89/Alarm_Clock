# AZAYA ALARM CLOCK

This is a simple alarm clock built with the Tkinter module. 
Running the code pops up a dialog box where you enter the alarm time in the format *HH-MM-AM|PM* and then you click on the "Add Alarm" button on the dialog box. If the input is invalid, the code exits with a message: "*Invalid time format.*"

When the alarm time comes, there is a long loud sound that plays for about 5 seconds. You can change the sound by replacing the **wav** file on line 26 with any alarm sound of your choice.

Line 70 to 100 of the code is the design of the dialog which you can redesign to your taste.
